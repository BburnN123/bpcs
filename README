BPCS Steganography: encoding/decoding messages hidden in a vessel image

Source: http://web.eece.maine.edu/~eason/steg/SPIE98.pdf

BEHAVIORS:
    encoding
        * expects a vessel image file, message file, and alpha value
        * hides the contents of a file inside a vessel image
    decoding
        * expects a vessel image file, and alpha value
        * recovers the message stored inside a vessel image
    capacity
        * expects a vessel image file and alpha value
        * assesses the maximum size of a message that could be encoded within the vessel image
